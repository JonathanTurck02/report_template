## High-Level Summary
This study aimed to assess the differences between the fecal microbiome of group 1 and 2. Only minor changes in the overall microbiome composition between group 1 and 2 were observed, with a substantial overlap of a subset of samples between the groups. Statistical analysis showed no significant separation of the fecal microbiome composition between the two groups. Differential abundance analysis revealed small differences on a species level between the groups. The diversity within the samples was significantly different between group 1 and group 2. Group 1 showed an increased species richness and evenness compared to group 2.

## Abstract
The objective of this study was to assess the differences between the fecal microbiome of group 1 and 2. Shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed. Differential abundance testing was performed in R using ANCOMBC. Beta diversity, the diversity between samples, revealed minor differences between group 1 and group 2, demonstrated as two clusters in the Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index. However, a substantial subset of the group 2 samples overlapped with group 1. Statistical analysis ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) showed no significant separation between the two groups (adjusted p-value: 0.85). Differential abundance analysis revealed small differences on a species level between the groups. The relative abundance of the species Clostridium P ventriculi (p<0.0001), Lactobacillus johnsonii (p<0.0001), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (p<0.0001), Streptococcus lutetiensis (p<0.0001), and Enterococcus D casseliflavus (p<0.0001) was significantly different between group 1 and group 2. Alpha diversity, the diversity within the samples, was significantly different between group 1 and group 2. Group 1 showed an increased species richness and evenness compared to group 2 (Shannon p=0.0022, Observed Features p=0.0011, Chao1 p=0.0012).
